# Glyco-informatics
All the R scripts are used to identify glycoproteome derived N-glycome, which is prepared by release from glycoproteome, purification, reduction and permethylation. The N-glycome samples should be measured by a mass spectrometry with high accuracy (e.g., Orbitrap). 

The R script_Human is an efficient algorithm to match the experimental data with the theoretical monosaccharide compositions (For human derived glycome only).

The R script_Mouse is an efficient algorithm to match the experimental data with the theoretical monosaccharide compositions (For mouse derived glycome only).
