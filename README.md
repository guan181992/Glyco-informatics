# Glyco-informatics
All the R scripts are used to identify glycoproteome derived glycome， which is prepared by release from glycoproteome，purification，reduction and permethylation. The glycome samples should be measured by a mass spectrometry with high accuracy (e.g. Orbitrap). 
The R script_Human is an efficient algorithm to match the experimental data with the theoretical monosaccharide compositions without any rglycan database (For human derived glycome only).
The R script_Mouse is an efficient algorithm to match the experimental data with the theoretical monosaccharide compositions without any glycan database (For mouse derived glycome only).
